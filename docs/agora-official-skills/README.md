# Agora Skills

**The fastest way to build real-time conversational AI applications and Voice Agents with your AI coding assistant.**

Agora Skills is the official knowledge pack that teaches your AI coding assistant how to build on Agora — from picking the right product to wiring up credentials and running the first demo.

It's especially strong for conversational AI today — voice agents, AI companions, AI tutors, customer support bots, and physical AI — while still covering broader real-time use cases like chat, recording, and RTC-based experiences.

## What This Skill Helps You Build

Developers use Agora Skills to build:

- **AI Voice Agents** — "I want to talk to an AI voice agent in my browser."
- **AI Tutors** — "Build an AI tutor that can speak with users in real time."
- **AI Companions** — "Create an AI companion with low-latency voice interaction and a custom personality."
- **AI Customer Service** — "Build an AI customer service voice agent to replace our IVR."
- **AI Voice Toys** — "Make a voice-enabled AI toy for kids with on-device wake word."
- **Physical AI** — "Add real-time voice to a robot, wearable, or in-car assistant."
- **Custom LLM Backends** — "Connect Agora Conversational AI to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, or my own model."

Agora Skills also covers real-time chat and messaging, session recording, production token generation, and traditional RTC scenarios (live streaming, voice chat rooms, live broadcast rooms) — see the capability table below for the full list.

## Quick Start

Copy this into your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Kiro, …):

> Install the Agora skill from https://github.com/AgoraIO/skills and use it.
> I want to build a voice AI agent demo. Walk me through the full setup.

With the Agora skill loaded, the agent can then:

1. **Log you into Agora** via the Agora CLI — opens a browser for free sign-up if you don't already have an account. No manual API key copy-pasting.
2. **Create an Agora project** and extract the App ID, App Certificate, and any required tokens automatically.
3. **Clone the official Conversational AI sample** that matches your target stack (Web, Next.js, iOS, Android, Python, Go…).
4. **Run the demo locally** so you can actually talk to the voice agent within minutes.
5. **Iterate from a working baseline** — swap the LLM (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / DeepSeek / Qwen / your own), change the system prompt, add tools, or wire it into your existing app.

You should not need to manually dig through the Agora Console just to get a first voice agent running.

## Installation

### Skills CLI

```bash
npx skills add github:AgoraIO/skills
```

### Agora CLI (for local onboarding)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.sh | sh
```

The installer is served from the Agora CDN, so it works in networks where GitHub is blocked. On Windows, use `irm https://dl.agora.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex`.

### Claude Code Plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add AgoraIO/skills
/plugin install agora@agora-skills
```

### Git Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/skills.git
```

Then point your tool at:

```bash
skills/agora/SKILL.md
```

This works with tools like **Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Kiro**, or any environment that can read markdown-based skill instructions.
